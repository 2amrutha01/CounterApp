# CounterApp
This Flutter app is a simple counter application using setState for state management. The UI consists of a blue AppBar, a centered counter display, and two styled ElevatedButton widgets for incrementing and decrementing.
_incrementCounter(): Increases the counter value and updates the UI.
_decrementCounter(): Decreases the counter if above zero; otherwise, shows a SnackBar warning.
